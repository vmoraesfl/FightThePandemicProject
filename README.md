# Welcome to the Fight the Pandemic Project

## Our Challenge

The Away from the Crowd Team is tackling the [HUMAN FACTORS](https://covid19.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/covid-challenges/human-factors/details) challenge.

## The Problem

With the rapidly increasing of COVID-19 cases around the globe, governments and authorities need reliable data to make fast and acerted decisions to mitigate deaths and slow down the spread of the infection. 

## Our Solution

We used transportation and touristic routes, population density and the use of light data, extracted from Nasa's database, in order to discover the patterns of the disease, thus creating a model to forecast the infection behaviour. We also designed a web-platform to make this data visible and available to everyone, so authorities can use this information to make better decisions.
